# Waterloo-CS-Circles-Solutions
Here you can see how I solved Computer Science Circles from the University of Waterloo. I am only displaying the answers to coding problems; i.e. I won't show the answers to a question that has the code out of order. Also, some of my variable names may not make the most sense. One day I might go back and fix them, but I just wanted to acknowledge that and say that these were some of the first scripts that I wrote.
